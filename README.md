## API setup

For now, we have set up a basic API from a guide (https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api/). 

Immediate Next steps (for Tuesday):

- deploy the app online
- send to Maria so she can test that it connects to Flow
- edit the JS and py files to add our summarization and docx reading functions. The first functionality we will work on is receiving a word document, and returning a text summary

Future Steps (post-Tuesday):

- add functionality for hyperlink checking
- look into storing documents in database for compiling / creating article documents
